              <h2>About me</h2>
              <hr style="margin-top: 0;">
              <div>
                  <p>It's been nearly a month since I was diagnosed with PSC (primary sclerosing cholangitis) and my health has been plummeting over the last few years.. Couple of months ago I reached tock bottom, and I have been forcefully striving to escape that hell. I am now fully determined to go any length so that I once again can move forward.</p>
                  <hr />
                  <p class="">The last months have been the hardest I have ever experienced and probably the hardest I will ever experience. In 2013 I was in Thailand and got infected with e-coli. I probably had a fever over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and I was even hallucinating. It’s the most sick I have ever been. I would rather have been that sick a hundred times rather than be in the situation I am now. I have Primary sclerosing cholangitis,% or PSC for short. I do not have all the symptoms, but I do suffer from generall fatigue and weekness, heavily affects me to the point where I sometimes lose consciousness.</p>

                  <p>Everything started the month after the World Championships in Columbia (fade colash from Cali). I became pretty sick for a few days, and in the junior NM I got a fracture in my back. Little did I know that something worse was developing. It actually took quite some time before I understood that my back had fractured. But when it became so bad that I could not even unplug my PC charger at school, I figured it wasn't any normal injury.</p>

                  <p>The fracture prevented me from jogging and exercising as I would normaly. As I had few options, all my exersice went towards balance, coordination and some stretching exercises.(video) With my exercise not really pushing me, I did not notice any of the symptoms from PSC. So when my back stopped hurting, I could start exercising properly again, but I became bedridden. Thinking that I had just gotten the flu or something I took it easy the next couple of days and then continued to train harder, (break, breathe heavily) but then I was bedridden again with a fever. I became bedridden every time I pushed my body outside its comfort zone. I kept on getting sick regardless of how I approached a proper heavy exercise load. I ended up finding a 'solution'.</p>

                  <p>Sleeping ~ 12 ~ hours ~ a ~ day. Keeping up with school became hard. My life started falling apart. At the end of the year I found a 'solution', as all the symptoms was associated with normal sinus infections (picture to ilustrate), I had a sinus operation. After 10 days of sick leave I managed to spend the last 3 days to go over the entire math syllabus. I ended up studying around 5 to 6 hours in one go. I succeeded in recovering my math grade and work towards pulling my other grades up. I felt relieved! I was now 'healthy' and done with the school year. I got back to 11 to 14 exercise sessions a week and felt that everything was going in the right direction. What I didn’t know was known was that my everyday would become incredible more difficult.</p>

                  <p>When school started after summer break, I got an entirely new load on top of all the exercise (geogebra sinus 0.5x ^ 2 sinx). My health began to deteriorate. Not too long after, like a ripple in a pond, My bad health began to take its effects. In the beginning, I didn’t notice that my health was deteriorating, but at the same time in October, I fully recovered from my back fracture and all the other injuries that came from it. I threw two throws over 69 m (227 feet) while it was 0 degrees outside, placing me as second best for men aged 18 in Norway at the time. (Bring video). Only after this dude (legg til Andreas"pfff”.)</p>

                  <p>Still making progress with my exercise, the opposite was happening everywhere else. It was first when I got 3's that it hit me, +++++++ (du må forklare karaktrersystemet før dette dukker opp) and i finished the first semester with a poor grade card. Placing my grade point average at close to 3 compared to my first year, you can see the difference. After November, my health began to deteriorate faster and faster, unlike anything I have ever experienced. By Christmas I figured that I could not catch up on everything. It only got worse. And it kept on getting worse to the point where my reading speed went down below 50 words per minute. And that looks like this: (video). Bad.</p>

                  <p>It was at this point I decided to change, I dedicated all my time towards studing with one exercise session each week to keep me in shape. (Video of studying) I started studying 60 hours a week out of school! Getting home at 16:30 I grabed some food, then I studyed from 5 AM to 11 PM every weekday. During the weekend I got up at 7 AM and studied to 11 PM. Doing this the following weeks my general health improved, thus my health becomming better. During finals I studied an extreem amount, as I had the entire math syllabus left. With (video) Physics on Monday, Tuesday off, the oral Norwegian exam on Wednesday, math on Thursday and finising up with the last exam, IT, on Friday. Starting the study session at 6 AM and continuing to 11 PM, I understood that I would end up far behind where I should be. I decided pulling several all nighters. I also ended up not reading one of the mandatory books I had to read for my Norwegian class. Therefore I had to study for my exam from 4 AM right untill my exam started, which was at 9 AM. After reciving a 5 I got really happy and headed home with my math book and continued studying. When the clock once again became 11 PM at this 41th hour I realise there still was more to to, pulling two consecutive all nighters felt I that I had good time. Finishing with decent result I headed home and started sleeping after the 60th hour, and I have never slept as good as I did then. This experience is something I am truly fond of. </p>

                  <p>And after all of this I truly feel that my health is getting better, even though I am not recovering from my illness, I will be in better health by pushing my body more than it wants. Therefore I have decided to start an extreme training regime. By training 70 hours a week I hope to. Since the only way I can revover my health is to forcfully push what my body and study as intense as possible, I now want to train as much as possible. I don't know if this is going to work, but no matter what, I will try.
